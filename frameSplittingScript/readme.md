WARNING: Under heavy construction and buggy.

Update: Code should work now if fed a clean telem file.
**Clean telem file**: A telemetry file where the first entry corresponds to the first frame of the video. Starting at the top of the file with no empty lines. The length of the telemetry file can be too long, as long as the startpoint of the telemetry file is correct.

Note to self: remember to change matching to binary search
